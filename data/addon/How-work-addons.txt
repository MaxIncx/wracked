############# How to add an add-on #####################

FIRST, don't put anything supsitious!

Then Extract the zip, it will add the new files to your foldes (or do it yourself)
Go in the main.html file and at the bottom put the name of the script you want to add between the two lines:

<!-- ADD BETWEEN HERE all the script you want to add, BE CAREFULL what you are using -->
PASTE HERE
<!-- ADD NOTHING AFTER HERE -->

Nothing before, nothing after the two line.

The line you have to paste should look like that:
<script src="./data/addon/unfinished-model.js"></script>

(If you do it now without the files it won't work, this is just an explanation ^^)

If "<!--" and "-->" are on the line, it's mean it's commentated and it won't work
