Noted</i></li><li>Any objects, contraptions, chemicals or food cannot be taken out of the Villa - <i>Don't steal... I get it</i></li><li>Any short or long physical transformation or mental change are the sole responsibilities of the contestants - <i>Strange way of saying \"If you have emotional distress keep it to yourself\"...</i></li><li>Contestants will be removed if they are too impaired or indecent - <i>So... Don't get drunk...</i></li><li>The game ends when there is only one housemate still participating and will be granted the big prize - <i>That will be me!</i></li></ul>",
